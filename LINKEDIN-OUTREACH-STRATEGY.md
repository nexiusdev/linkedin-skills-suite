## 360Brew Algorithm (2026)

LinkedIn's 360Brew is a 150B parameter decoder-only foundation model that has transformed the platform from a "broadcast" model to a "Topic Authority" model. It uses Many-Shot In-Context Learning to evaluate if your outreach, profile, and content form a logically consistent narrative of expertise.

### Key Technical Pillars

| Feature | 360Brew Treatment | Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Profile-to-Post Alignment** | Must match 80% | Content must align with profile keywords |
| **Saves** | 5x value of Likes, 2x Comments | Create Save-worthy assets (schemas, PRDs) |
| **Semantic Reasoning** | Quality of argument matters | Logically structured posts outperform engagement-bait |
| **Zero-Shot Capability** | New profiles can trend | High-value niche content can go viral without followers |
| **Hashtags** | Obsolescent | AI reads full text; hashtags provide no boost |
| **External Links** | -60% reach penalty | Put links in first comment only |
| **Golden Hour** | First 60-90 mins critical | Engage 5-10 posts before/after your post |
| **Depth Score** | Measures dwell time | Longer-form engaging content rewarded |
| **Single Images** | -30% vs text-only | Use carousels/PDFs instead of single images |
| **Response Time** | +35% reach boost | Reply to comments within 1 hour |
| **AI Content** | Neutral | Algorithm penalizes generic writing, not AI writing |

### Topic Authority Requirements

360Brew "cross-references" your DMs and posts against your profile to verify your "Right to Speak":

1. **About Section as System Prompt**: First 2 paragraphs must name 2-3 core pillars
2. **Headline as Entity Signal**: Use specific, indexable keywords the AI can parse
3. **Skill Tags as Semantic Weights**: Core skills directly influence content distribution
4. **Content Alignment**: If profile says "Agentic AI" but you post motivational quotes, flagged as "Low Authority"

---

## Profile Optimization

### Headline Structure

**Bad:** "Revolutionizing SMEs with AI"
**Good:** "Building Agentic ERP & CRM Systems for Singapore SMEs | Founder at Nexius Labs | Agentic AI Expert"

The headline must contain:
- Specific entity keywords (Agentic AI, ERP, CRM)
- Target market (Singapore SMEs)
- Role identifier (Founder)
- Authority signal (Expert)

### About Section

The About section acts as a "System Prompt" for the algorithm:

1. **First 2 paragraphs**: Name 2-3 core pillars explicitly
   - Agentic AI workflows
   - SQL/Schema Automation
   - SME Workflow Optimization

2. **Clear, structured language**: The algorithm must parse your expertise areas

3. **Verification function**: 360Brew cross-references this against your DMs and posts

### Skill Tags

Ensure these appear in your top skills:
- Agentic AI
- SQL Schema Design
- Business Process Automation
- ERP Implementation
- AI Workflow Design

These directly influence who sees your content.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Positioning Summary

Helps SMEs adopt Agentic AI to automate business operations (finance, ERP, CRM, inventory) so they can work faster without extra manpower. Also trains non-coders and developers to build AI workflows.

### Geographic Focus (STRICT)

**ASEAN-5 ONLY - No Exceptions:**
- Singapore (primary)
- Malaysia
- Thailand
- Indonesia
- Philippines

Any prospect outside these 5 countries is immediately skipped. No "proceed with caution" for unclear geography.

### Target Job Roles

**Primary (Decision-Makers):**
| Role | Why They Care |
|------|---------------|
| SME Founders/CEOs | Want to scale without hiring |
| Operations Directors | Own process efficiency |
| Finance Directors/CFOs | Automate accounting workflows |
| Managing Directors | Drive digital transformation |

**Secondary (Influencers):**
| Role | Why They Champion |
|------|-------------------|
| Operations Managers | Feel manual work pain daily |
| IT Managers | Evaluate AI/automation tools |
| Business Analysts | Champion workflow improvements |

### Target Industries

**Primary:**
- Accounting & Finance Services
- Professional Services
- E-commerce/Retail
- Manufacturing SMEs

**Adjacent:**
- Logistics & Supply Chain
- Healthcare Clinics
- Real Estate Agencies

### Target Company Profile

- **Size:** 10-200 employees (SME sweet spot)
- **Stage:** Established SME looking to scale efficiently
- **Geography:** Singapore, Malaysia, Southeast Asia (ASEAN)
- **Tech Maturity:** Low-Medium (ready for AI but not there yet)

### Pain Keywords to Monitor

manual work, automation, efficiency, scale, workflow, AI adoption, digital transformation, streamline, productivity, reduce overhead

---

## Contact Classification System

Every LinkedIn contact is classified into one of three categories for tailored engagement.

### Classification Criteria

| Category | Follower Range | Key Signals | Engagement Goal |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **PEER** | 1K - 10K | Same niche, content creator, builder | Collaboration, mutual support |
| **THOUGHT LEADER** | 10K+ | Established authority, high engagement | Visibility, credibility |
| **PROSPECT** | Any | Decision-maker at SME, ICP match | Lead generation |

### Quick Classification Logic

```
1. Check if PROSPECT first (role-based, not follower-based):
   → Is this person a potential CUSTOMER?
   → Decision-maker at SME? Pain points you solve?
   → If YES → PROSPECT (proceed to ICP screening)

2. If NOT a prospect, check followers:
   → 10K+ followers → THOUGHT LEADER
   → 1K-10K + same niche/builder → PEER
   → <1K or irrelevant niche → GENERAL (lower priority)
```

### Category-Specific Comment Strategies

**PEER (1K-10K followers, same niche):**
- Tone: Collaborative, collegial, "we're in this together"
- Strategy: Share complementary insights, extend their thinking
- Patterns: Extension/Building, Pattern Recognition
- Example: "We hit the same wall with [X]. What worked for us was [Y]. Curious if you've tried [Z]?"

**THOUGHT LEADER (10K+ followers):**
- Tone: Respectful but confident, add unique POV
- Strategy: Stand out from generic comments, ask thoughtful questions
- Patterns: Challenge/Reframe, Question/Probe
- Example: "Interesting framing. In production, I've seen [counter-pattern]. Is that an edge case or am I missing something?"

**PROSPECT (ICP match):**
- Tone: Empathetic, demonstrate expertise without pitching
- Strategy: Mirror their pain, add insight, low-friction question
- Patterns: Empathy + Reframe, Validation + Insight
- Example: "That [pain point] resonates. Most teams I work with find the bottleneck isn't [obvious thing]. It's [underlying cause]. What's your current workaround?"

## Content Strategy

### The 40/40/20 Rule

| Content Type | Percentage | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Educational | 40% | Teach frameworks, break down complexity |
| Evidence/Stories | 40% | Case studies, build-in-public, deployment lessons |
| Engagement/Perspective | 20% | Polls, contrarian takes to spark debate |

### High-Value Formats for 360Brew

| Format | Performance Boost | Best Use |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Native Video (60-90s) | +69% | Technical demos, behind-the-scenes |
| PDF Carousels | High | Step-by-step guides (mobile-friendly) |
| Save-worthy Assets | Maximum | Schemas, PRDs, logic diagrams |

### Save-Worthy Assets (Top Priority)

In the 360Brew environment, "Save-worthy" assets are the single most important factor for building Topic Authority. A Save is valued 5x more than a Like, 2x more than a Comment.

**The Utility Test:** Can the reader use this to save 2 hours of work today?

**Three Core Asset Formats:**

1. **Modular Schema (SQL/JSON)**
   - Share actual database schemas for specific modules
   - Why saved: Developers use as reference for their builds
   - Hook: "Don't start your Agentic CRM from scratch. Here is the SQL schema I used to handle multi-agent state management."

2. **Agentic Logic Diagram**
   - Visual map: Trigger → Retrieval → Reasoning → Action → Feedback Loop
   - Why saved: Non-coders explain to stakeholders, use as n8n blueprint
   - Hook: "Most SME automations fail because they lack a feedback loop. Here is the 5-step logic map we use at Nexius Labs."

3. **Rapid PRD Template**
   - Structured Product Requirements Document for AI tools
   - Why saved: Product managers seeking better prompt-engineering
   - Hook: "I've turned 5 years of building into this 1-page PRD template for AI Agents. Save this for your next build."

**Save-Optimization Layout:**
1. **The Context (Why)**: Identify friction point
2. **The Solution (Asset)**: State what you're sharing
3. **The Visual Anchor**: High-quality PDF or clean image
4. **The CTA**: "Save this post so you can refer back..."

### Day-Specific Content Schedule

| Day | Content Focus | Post Type | Primary Window (SGT) | Secondary Window |
|-----|--------------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Monday | Strategy/Planning | Frameworks, week-starter | 10:00-11:30 AM | 4:00-5:30 PM |
| Tuesday | Technical Demo (PEAK) | Video demos, architectures | 8:30-10:30 AM | 12:00-1:30 PM |
| Wednesday | Save-Worthy Asset | SQL schemas, JSON imports | 9:00-11:00 AM | 3:00-5:00 PM |
| Thursday | Thought Leadership | Predictions, frameworks | 10:00 AM-12:00 PM | 1:00-2:30 PM |
| Friday | Reflection | Personal stories, lessons | 8:30-10:00 AM | None |
| Weekend | Engagement Only | No posting | - | - |

### 12-Hour Posting Rule

**Minimum 12 hours between posts.** This prevents algorithm fatigue and ensures full distribution.

```
Check before scheduling:
1. Read shared log → Last post timestamp
2. Calculate hours_since_last = current_time - last_post_time
3. If hours_since_last < 12:
   → next_valid_time = last_post_time + 12 hours
   → Find posting window ON OR AFTER next_valid_time
4. If hours_since_last >= 12:
   → Can post in current window
```

---

## Engagement Strategy

### The 15-Word Commenting Rule

Comments under 15 words (e.g., "Great post!") are filtered as "low-value" by 360Brew. The algorithm now rewards meaningful contributions.

**Comment Requirements:**
- **Minimum:** 15 words
- **Maximum:** 50 words (conciseness forces clarity)
- **Must include:** Point of view or insight
- **Bonus:** Ask a question to encourage thread depth (extends post life 48+ hours)

### The "Did I Actually Read This?" Test

Before generating ANY comment:

**Content Understanding:**
- What's the specific insight or argument?
- What evidence or examples are provided?
- What assumptions underlie their position?

**Your Genuine Response:**
- Do I agree, disagree, or partially agree? Why?
- What does this remind me of from hands-on experience?
- What's being overlooked or could be challenged?
- What question is worth exploring?

**Litmus Test:** Could someone write this exact comment without reading the post? If yes, start over.

### Comment Patterns (STRICT: No em-dashes)

**Pattern 1: Extension/Building**
"Yes, and here's what this connects to..."

**Pattern 2: Challenge/Reframe**
"I see it differently because..."

**Pattern 3: Question/Probe**
"This raises an interesting question about..."

**Pattern 4: Pattern Recognition**
"This matches what I'm seeing where..."

### The 3-3-3 Rule (Daily Minimum)

- 3 comments on **PEER** posts (1K-10K followers)
- 3 comments on **PROSPECT** posts (ICP matches)
- 3 comments on **THOUGHT LEADER** posts (10K+ followers)

**Growth Baseline:** 5-15 high-quality comments/day

### The 15/15 Rule

- 15 minutes engaging **before** you post your content
- 15 minutes engaging **after** you post
- This "warms" your topical relevance for 4 hours of distribution

### Golden Hour (60-90 Minutes)

Engage with 5-10 posts immediately before/after posting. This triggers:
- Reciprocal views from notifications
- "Warms" your account for algorithm distribution
- Signals active contributor status (not a bot)

**Note:** The critical window is 60-90 minutes after posting. Early engagement in this window determines if LinkedIn expands your post's reach.

### Post Reactivation Tactic

Re-boost older posts by engaging with them:
- Comment on or reshare your own posts at **8 hours** or **24 hours** after publishing
- This pushes them back into feeds and extends content lifespan
- Works best on posts that had strong initial engagement

### Expected Reach Benchmarks (2026)

Average post reach has declined significantly:
- **Current benchmark:** 8-12% of followers see your posts
- **Previous (2024-2025):** 15-20% of followers
- High-performing posts with strong early engagement can exceed these benchmarks
- Quality engagement (saves, multi-sentence comments) matters more than ever

---

## Connection Request Strategy

### The 2-3 Touch Rule (Semantic Bridge)

360Brew monitors the "relevance gap" between you and connection targets. Cold requests get flagged as spam.

**Multi-Touch Journey:**

| Timeline | Action | 360Brew Benefit |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| T-48 hours | Follow profile + Save their post | Name enters notification feed |
| T-24 hours | Leave 15+ word comment | Indexed in "Engagement Graph" |
| T-0 (Now) | Send connection request | High acceptance rate (30%+) |

### Connection Approach by Touch Count

| Touches | Approach | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | DO NOT CONNECT | Still warming, need more engagement |
| 2 | Asset-led note | Minimum threshold, offer value |
| 3+ | Blank request | Strong signal, blank performs 12% better |

### The Blank Request Paradox

Data shows blank connection requests (no note) perform 10-15% better than templated notes, unless the note is 100% bespoke.

**Use blank request when:**
- You have 2+ meaningful engagements
- Your last comment was substantive and recent (within 48h)
- Their content aligns with your profile keywords

**Use asset-led note when:**
- Only 1 engagement touch point
- Their post mentioned a specific pain point you can address
- You have a relevant PRD/schema/asset to offer

### Asset-Led Note Template

```
Hi [Name], caught your post on [Topic].

I'm currently mapping out an Agentic ERP logic specifically for [Their Industry]
to automate [Specific Pain Point]. I've documented the workflow schema—would
love to send it over if you're curious.

(Keep under 250 characters)
```

### Optimal Send Timing

**Best Windows (SGT):**
- Tuesday-Thursday: 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM
- Secondary: Tuesday-Thursday: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM

**Avoid:**
- Mondays (inbox overload)
- Fridays (weekend mindset)
- Weekends (low activity)
- After 6 PM (low response)

### Commonality Clusters

360Brew prioritizes "Tribal Relevance." Focus requests in clusters:

**Singapore SME Cluster:** People in same local industry group or who commented on same SME-focused post

**Tech-Stack Cluster:** People who follow n8n, Supabase, or Agentic AI content

**Benefit:** Once 3-4 people in a cluster accept, 360Brew auto-suggests you to the rest.

```

---

## Daily Limits & Guardrails

### 360Brew Safe Limits

**Exceeding these triggers LinkedIn's Automation Detection System (ADS).**

| Activity | Daily Limit | Target | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Posts** | 1-2 max | 1 | 12-hour minimum between posts |
| **Comments** | 30 max | 9-15 | Quality > quantity; 15-50 words each |
| **Connection Requests** | 100-200/week (~15-20/day) | 5-10 | Rolling 7-day window; blank requests preferred |
| **DMs (New Conversations)** | 25 max | 5-10 | No links in first DM |
| **DM Follow-ups** | 50 max | As needed | Existing conversations only |
| **Likes/Reactions** | 100 max | 20-50 | Don't mass-like |
| **Profile Views (outbound)** | 80 max | 20-30 | Quality screening only |
| **Follows** | 20 max | 5-10 | Follow-for-follow is flagged |

### Limit Check Logic

```
BEFORE COMMENTING:
  → Read today's comment count from shared log
  → If count >= 30: STOP, log "Daily comment limit reached"
  → If count >= 25: WARN "Approaching comment limit (25/30)"

BEFORE SENDING CONNECTION:
  → Read this week's connection request count (rolling 7-day window)
  → If weekly count >= 100: STOP, log "Weekly connection limit reached"
  → Daily guidance: ~15-20/day max, but weekly total matters more
  → If acceptance rate < 30%: Reduce volume, improve targeting

BEFORE SENDING DM:
  → Read today's new DM count
  → If count >= 25: STOP, log "Daily DM limit reached"
  → If count >= 20: WARN "Approaching DM limit (20/25)"
```

### Warning Signs of Over-Engagement

If you see these, STOP immediately:
- LinkedIn shows "Something went wrong" errors
- Comments fail to post
- Connection requests get "pending" instantly
- Profile shows "restricted" warnings
- Temporary action blocks (24-72 hours)

**Recovery Protocol:**
1. Stop ALL engagement for 24 hours
2. Resume at 50% of normal limits for 3 days
3. Gradually return to normal limits over 1 week

### Red Flags to Avoid

- **Post and Ghost**: Posting without interacting is penalized
- **"Comment YES" tactics**: Downranked in 2026
- **Tagging Overload**: Max 3-5 people; more = spam
- **30+ short comments/day**: Interpreted as automation
- **External links in first DM**: Flagged as low-trust

## Appendix: Adapting This Strategy for Other Businesses

This strategy can be adapted for any business. Below is a breakdown of what's universal vs. what needs customization.

### Universal Components (No Changes Needed)

These work for any business:

| Component | Why Universal |
|-----------|---------------|
| 360Brew algorithm rules | Platform mechanics apply to everyone |
| Daily time blocks structure | Best practices for any LinkedIn user |
| Comment limits (15-50 words) | Algorithm requirement |
| Connection timing (48h rule, 2-3 touches) | Platform behavior |
| Daily limits (15 connections, 30 comments, etc.) | Safety guardrails |
| Save-worthy asset concept | Content strategy framework |
| Golden Hour, 15/15 rule | Engagement mechanics |
| Skill workflows & automation scripts | Process automation |

### Files That Need Customization

#### HIGH Priority (Must Change)

| File | What's Personalized | What to Change |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| `references/icp-profile.md` | Target roles, industries, geography, pain keywords | Replace entirely with new ICP |
| `references/contact-classification.md` | PEER niche signals, PROSPECT criteria | Update niche keywords, industry focus |
| `linkedin-icp-finder/skill.md` | **Hardcoded ASEAN-5 geography filter** | Change to new target geography |
| `LINKEDIN-OUTREACH-STRATEGY.md` | Entire document references Melverick/Nexius Labs | Regenerate for new business |

#### MEDIUM Priority (Should Update)

| File | What's Personalized | What to Change |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| `linkedin-elite-post/skill.md` | "Nexius Labs positioning" context | Update positioning section |
| `linkedin-pro-commenter/skill.md` | "When to Mention Nexius Labs", deployment examples | Update company name, example metrics |
| `linkedin-trender/skill.md` | "Positioning Context" section | Update niche keywords, angles |
| `references/linkedin-strategy.md` | "Agentic AI and SME Automation" references | Update to new domain/focus |
| `references/connect-request.md` | Asset-led note templates, "Nexius Style" | Update templates, company name |
| `references/saved-asset.md` | Example schemas, hooks reference Agentic ERP | Update asset examples for new domain |

#### LOW Priority (Generic/Optional)

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `linkedin-profile-icp/skill.md` | Already generic - analyzes any profile |
| `linkedin-post-finder/skill.md` | Topic focus can stay or change |
| `linkedin-icp-warmer/skill.md` | Generic workflow |
| `linkedin-connect-timer/skill.md` | Generic workflow |
| `linkedin-image-generator/skill.md` | Generic workflow |
| `linkedin-daily-planner/skill.md` | Generic workflow (time blocks universal) |
| PowerShell scripts | Just change file paths |

### Quick Adaptation Checklist

For a new user to adopt this system:

```
1. [ ] Run linkedin-profile-icp on their LinkedIn profile
       → Generates their ICP criteria automatically

2. [ ] Update references/icp-profile.md with output from step 1

3. [ ] Update references/contact-classification.md
       → Change PEER niche signals to their industry
       → Change PROSPECT criteria to their ICP

4. [ ] Update linkedin-icp-finder/skill.md
       → Replace ASEAN-5 geography filter with their target region
       → Or remove geography filter if targeting globally

5. [ ] Search & replace across files:
       → "Nexius Labs" → [Their company]
       → "Agentic AI" → [Their domain]
       → "SME" → [Their target market]
       → "Singapore" → [Their primary market]

6. [ ] Update example templates in:
       → references/connect-request.md
       → references/saved-asset.md

7. [ ] Regenerate LINKEDIN-OUTREACH-STRATEGY.md
```

### Adaptation Summary

| Category | File Count | Effort |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Must change | 4 files | High |
| Should update | 6 files | Medium |
| Generic/optional | 6 files | Low/None |

The core **workflow logic** is 100% reusable. The **positioning content** needs customization. Most changes are find-and-replace operations, with the ICP profile being the most important customization.
