# LinkedIn Value DM Framework

## Critical Rules

**NEVER offer solutions, workflows, or frameworks in first DMs.**

The goal is to build a relationship through genuine curiosity, NOT to pitch.

## When to Send Value DMs

**ONLY send to:** New PROSPECT connections (24-48 hours after acceptance)

**DO NOT send to:**
- Peers (engage via comments instead)
- Thought Leaders (engage via comments instead)
- Prospects with < 2 touches (warm them up first)

## DM Patterns

Choose ONE pattern based on prospect context:

### Pattern 1: Specific Curiosity

Reference something specific from their profile or recent activity.

**Template:**
> "Saw your work at [Company] [specific detail from their profile]. Curious how you [specific challenge related to their role]? We're seeing [related observation] in [their industry] in your target geography (read from `references/icp-profile.md`)."

**Example:**
> "Saw your work at TechCorp on digital transformation. Curious how you're navigating the manual process automation piece? We're seeing a lot of resistance to AI adoption in [target geography] manufacturing."

### Pattern 2: Thoughtful Question

Ask about their biggest challenge or friction point.

**Template:**
> "Your focus on [their area] caught my eye. What's the biggest [mindset shift/challenge/friction point] you see companies struggle with when [relevant transition/problem]?"

**Example:**
> "Your focus on operations optimization caught my eye. What's the biggest friction point you see SMEs struggle with when trying to automate their workflows?"

### Pattern 3: Shared Observation

Share a pattern you're noticing and ask for their take.

**Template:**
> "Read your take on [specific post topic]. We're noticing the same pattern with [relevant detail] - especially around [specific angle]. How are you approaching [their challenge]?"

**Example:**
> "Read your take on [relevant topic]. We're noticing the same pattern with SMEs in your target geography - especially around [specific angle]. How are you approaching [their challenge] with your clients?"

### Pattern 4: Acknowledge Insight

Reference a specific point they made and ask a follow-up question.

**Template:**
> "Your point about [specific thing they said] resonates. Seeing this play out differently across [geography/industry] - have you noticed [interesting pattern/question]?"

**Example:**
> "Your point about [specific thing they said] really resonates. Seeing this play out differently across markets - have you noticed any cultural patterns in how teams respond to [relevant topic]?"

## DM Writing Checklist

Before sending, verify:

- ✅ References something SPECIFIC from their profile/post (not generic)
- ✅ Asks a REAL question you're genuinely curious about
- ✅ Shares an observation WITHOUT offering a solution
- ✅ Under 50 words
- ✅ NO "happy to share" phrases
- ✅ NO "let me know if" phrases
- ✅ NO offers of frameworks, workflows, or solutions
- ✅ NO external links
- ❌ Does NOT sound like a pitch

## What NOT to Do

**❌ Generic opening:**
> "Hi [Name], great to connect! I help SMEs with automation..."

**❌ Solution offering:**
> "Happy to share a framework we use for this if you're interested."

**❌ Pitchy language:**
> "I noticed you might benefit from our approach to..."

**❌ External links:**
> "Check out this article I wrote: [link]"

## Follow-Up Guidelines

**If they reply:**
- Continue the conversation naturally
- Ask deeper questions based on their response
- Share relevant observations or examples (NOT pitches)
- Wait until they ask "how do you do this?" before offering anything

**If no reply after 3 days:**
- Don't follow up with another DM
- Continue engaging with their posts
- Let the relationship develop organically

## Example DM Sequences

### Good Sequence

**DM 1 (Initial):**
> "Your focus on finance automation for SMEs caught my eye. What's the biggest mindset shift you see CFOs struggle with when moving from Excel to proper systems?"

**They reply:**
> "Great question! I'd say it's the fear of losing control over their data. They've been using Excel for 10+ years and trust it."

**DM 2 (Continue conversation):**
> "That makes total sense. We're seeing the same thing - especially the 'I can see everything in Excel' argument. How do you typically address that trust gap?"

**They reply:**
> "Usually by showing them a sandbox environment first. Let them play around without committing. How do you approach it?"

**DM 3 (Now they're asking - you can share):**
> "Similar approach - we build a proof of concept with their actual data so they can see the comparison side-by-side. The 'aha moment' usually comes when they realize the time savings."

### Bad Sequence

**DM 1 (Too pitchy):**
> "Hi [Name], I help SMEs automate their finance operations using AI agents. I noticed you work with similar clients - happy to share some frameworks we use if you're interested!"

**Result:** No reply (sounds like a pitch)

## Notes

- This framework prioritizes relationship building over selling
- Value DMs should feel like starting a conversation with someone at a conference
- If you wouldn't say it in person, don't say it in a DM
- Genuine curiosity beats clever copywriting
