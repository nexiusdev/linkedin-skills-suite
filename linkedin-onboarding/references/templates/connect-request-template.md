# Connection Request Strategy - {{COMPANY_NAME}}

In 2026, the **360Brew** algorithm monitors the "relevance gap" between you and your connection requests. If you send requests to people who have no topical overlap with your content, LinkedIn's AI flags you as a "broad-spectrum recruiter" or "spammer," which suppresses your post reach.

For your ICP ({{TARGET_ROLES_SHORT}}), use this **"Semantic Bridge"** strategy:

---

### 1. The "Pre-Flight" Interaction (48-Hour Rule)

Never send a "cold" request. 360Brew rewards **multi-touch journeys**.

* **T-Minus 48 Hours:** Follow their profile and "Save" one of their posts.
* **T-Minus 24 Hours:** Leave a **15+ word comment** on their post that adds value or asks a thoughtful question about {{THEIR_DOMAIN}}.
* **The Result:** When you finally hit "Connect," your name is already indexed in their notification feed and the 360Brew "Engagement Graph."

### 2. The "Asset-Led" Connection Note

In 2026, "I'd love to join your network" is dead. You must lead with a **"Proof Asset"** that aligns with your expertise.

**Template: The "Value-First" Approach**

> "Hi [Name], caught your post on [Topic]. I'm currently working on {{ASSET_TYPE}} specifically for {{THEIR_INDUSTRY}} to help with {{PAIN_POINT}}. I've documented {{ASSET_DESCRIPTION}}—would love to send it over if you're curious about how we're {{OUTCOME}} at {{COMPANY_NAME}}."

* **Why it works:** It uses "Entity Keywords" ({{ENTITY_KEYWORDS}}) that 360Brew recognizes as your core expertise.

### 3. The "Blank Request" Paradox

If you cannot write a truly bespoke note, **send no note at all.**

* **The 2026 Data:** 360Brew's AI often flags "templated" notes as bot-generated. A blank request from a profile that has recently "Saved" or "Commented" on the recipient's content often has a **12% higher acceptance rate** than a generic note.

### 4. Optimize for "Commonality Clusters"

360Brew prioritizes "Tribal Relevance." Focus your requests in clusters:

* **The {{GEOGRAPHY}} Cluster:** Connect with 5–10 people in the same local industry group or who commented on the same {{DOMAIN}}-focused post.
* **The Tech-Stack Cluster:** Connect with people who follow {{TECH_TOOLS}}.
* **The Benefit:** Once 3–4 people in a "cluster" accept you, 360Brew begins auto-suggesting you to the rest of that circle.

### 5. Strategy Summary for {{COMPANY_NAME}}

| Feature | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| **Daily Volume** | **Max 15 requests.** Quality over quantity keeps your "Acceptance Rate" high (>30%). |
| **Note Length** | **Under 250 characters.** Keep it punchy and value-focused. |
| **Call to Action** | **Low Friction.** Offer a {{ASSET_TYPE_SHORT}} rather than a "15-min call." |
| **Timing** | **Tuesday–Thursday, 9:00 AM – 10:30 AM ({{TIMEZONE}}).** High active usage window for {{TARGET_MARKET}}. |
