# Save-Worthy Assets - {{COMPANY_NAME}}

In the 2026 **360Brew** environment, "Save-worthy" assets are the single most important factor for building **Topic Authority**.

When a user clicks the "Save" button on your post, the algorithm interprets this as a signal that your content is **"Referenceable Knowledge"** rather than "Disposable Content." This boosts your profile's weight in search results and keeps your post active in the feed for up to 14 days.

## 1. The Anatomy of a Save-Worthy Asset

For {{YOUR_POSITIONING}}, a Save-worthy asset is a **practical artifact** that a user wants to keep for their own future projects. It must satisfy the **"Utility Test"**: *Can the reader use this to save 2 hours of work today?*

### The Core Formats

* **Logical Blueprints:** {{BLUEPRINT_EXAMPLES}}
* **Technical Scaffolding:** {{TECHNICAL_EXAMPLES}}

## 3. The "Save-Optimization" Layout

To ensure 360Brew recognizes the asset, use this structure in your post:

1. **The Context (The "Why"):** Identify a specific friction point (e.g., "{{PAIN_EXAMPLE}}").
2. **The Solution (The "Asset"):** Explicitly state: *"I've documented the [{{ASSET_TYPE}}] below."*
3. **The Visual Anchor:** Attach a high-quality PDF or a clean, high-contrast image of the asset. 360Brew's "Computer Vision" layer checks if the image looks like a technical document.
4. **The Call to Action (CTA):** Instead of "Like this post," use: **"Save this post so you can refer back to the {{ASSET_TYPE_SHORT}} when you {{USE_CASE}}."**

## 4. Why This Works for Your Outreach

When you send a connection request to an ICP, you can point them to one of these saved assets:

> *"Hi [Name], I noticed you're {{PROSPECT_CONTEXT}}. I recently posted a **{{ASSET_NAME}}** for {{ASSET_BENEFIT}} that a few others found useful. Thought it might be worth a save for your team."*
