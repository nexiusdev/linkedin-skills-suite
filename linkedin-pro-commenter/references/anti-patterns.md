# Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

These are the performative garbage patterns that prove you didn't actually engage:

## Generic Praise

**"Great insights!"**
- Which insights? What made them great? Be specific or be silent.

**"This really resonates"**
- Why? What experience does it connect to? Empty validation.

**"Thanks for sharing"**
- This isn't email. Have a real response or move on.

## Content Recycling

**Summarizing the post back**
- The author already said it. What do YOU think?

**Paraphrasing as engagement**
- Rewording their point doesn't add value

## Empty Expertise

**Generic expertise signaling**
- "As someone in this space..." without saying anything substantive

**Credential dropping without substance**
- Mentioning your role/company without adding insight

## Form Over Function

**Perfectly formatted emptiness**
- Beautiful paragraphs that say nothing specific

**Question asking as engagement bait**
- Unless you're genuinely curious, don't fake it

**Formulaic responses**
- "Point 1 was great, Point 2 was insightful, Point 3 made me think"

## The Litmus Test

Ask yourself: **Could this exact comment be copy-pasted to 50 other posts?**

If yes → it's performative garbage, start over.
