# Project Memory Template

Use this file as optional working memory for the current client setup.

## Guardrails

- Keep notes generic and reusable across clients.
- Do not store personal data, prospect lists, emails, or private URLs.
- Do not commit runtime/client-specific notes to the public repository.

## Stable Learnings

- Add durable implementation lessons here.
- Keep entries tool- and workflow-focused.

## Current Decisions

- Record active architecture or workflow decisions.
- Include why the decision was made.

## Open Issues

- Remove entries once resolved.
