# Options Flow Basics

Understanding unusual options activity to follow institutional "smart money."

## What is Options Flow?

Options flow refers to the real-time tracking of large options trades to identify where institutional investors, hedge funds, and other "whales" are placing their bets.

### Why It Matters

- **Early signals**: Options trades often precede stock moves
- **Leverage insight**: Options provide 10-100x leverage, so serious money = serious conviction
- **Directional bias**: Large call buying = bullish, large put buying = bearish
- **Risk/reward visibility**: See where whales think stocks are heading

## Key Concepts

### 1. Premium

The total dollar amount paid for an options contract.

**Formula**: `Premium = Price × Volume × 100`

- Price: Cost per option ($5.00)
- Volume: Number of contracts (1,000)
- Multiplier: 100 shares per contract
- **Premium**: $5.00 × 1,000 × 100 = $500,000

**Why it matters**: High premium = serious conviction. A $500K bet isn't retail noise.

### 2. Volume

Number of contracts traded today.

- **High volume**: Indicates active trading and interest
- **Unusual volume**: Volume significantly higher than normal
- **Volume spike**: Sudden surge in trading activity

### 3. Open Interest (OI)

Number of contracts currently open (not yet closed or expired).

- **Growing OI**: New positions being opened (bullish/bearish conviction)
- **Shrinking OI**: Positions being closed (profit-taking or cutting losses)

### 4. Volume/OI Ratio

The ratio of volume to open interest.

**Interpretation**:
- **Ratio < 1**: Normal activity (existing positions trading)
- **Ratio 2-5x**: Elevated activity (some new positions)
- **Ratio 5x+**: **UNUSUAL** - massive new positions opening (our threshold)

**Example**:
- Volume: 10,000 contracts
- Open Interest: 2,000 contracts
- Ratio: 5.0x (UNUSUAL - 10,000 new contracts vs 2,000 existing)

### 5. Strike Price

The price at which the option can be exercised.

**Relevance**:
- **OTM (Out of The Money)**: Strike above current price (calls) or below (puts)
  - Cheaper, more leverage, higher risk
  - Example: Stock at $100, $110 call is OTM
- **ATM (At The Money)**: Strike near current price
  - Moderate cost and leverage
  - Example: Stock at $100, $100 call is ATM
- **ITM (In The Money)**: Strike below current price (calls) or above (puts)
  - More expensive, less leverage, lower risk
  - Example: Stock at $100, $90 call is ITM

### 6. Days to Expiration (DTE)

Time remaining until the option expires.

**Categories**:
- **0-7 DTE**: Weekly options (high risk, high reward)
- **7-30 DTE**: Short-term (monthly options)
- **30-90 DTE**: Mid-term (quarterly)
- **90+ DTE**: LEAPS (long-term)

**Why it matters**: Shorter DTE = more aggressive bet on near-term move.

### 7. Bid vs Ask

- **Bid**: What buyers are willing to pay
- **Ask**: What sellers are asking
- **Last Price**: Price of the last executed trade

**Aggressiveness**:
- **Near ask**: Aggressive buying (bullish)
- **Near bid**: Aggressive selling (bearish)
- **Mid-price**: Neutral

## Flow Direction Interpretation

### Bullish Signals

1. **Large call buying** (at/near ask price)
   - Whale aggressively buying calls
   - Betting on stock going UP

2. **Large put selling**
   - Whale collecting premium, willing to buy stock lower
   - Confident stock won't drop

3. **Call sweeps**
   - Buying calls across multiple strikes
   - Very bullish

### Bearish Signals

1. **Large put buying** (at/near ask price)
   - Whale aggressively buying puts
   - Betting on stock going DOWN or hedging longs

2. **Large call selling**
   - Whale selling/closing calls
   - Less bullish or taking profits

3. **Put sweeps**
   - Buying puts across multiple strikes
   - Very bearish

## Signal Quality Tiers

### Tier 1: Golden Sweep (Highest Quality)
- Premium: $100K+
- Volume: 2x+ open interest
- Type: Aggressive multi-strike buying
- **Action**: Strongest signal, high conviction

### Tier 2: Unusual Volume
- Premium: $50K+
- Volume: 5x+ open interest
- **Action**: Significant new positioning

### Tier 3: Large Block
- Premium: $100K+
- Volume: Any
- **Action**: Institutional-sized trade

## Common Mistakes for Beginners

1. **Blindly following every flow**
   - Whales can be wrong
   - May be hedging existing positions
   - Always combine with technical analysis

2. **Ignoring the bid/ask**
   - Selling at bid = bearish
   - Buying at ask = bullish
   - Context matters

3. **Not considering DTE**
   - 0-7 DTE: Swing trade or event-driven
   - 30-90 DTE: Position trade
   - Different time horizons require different strategies

4. **Confusing hedging with conviction**
   - Funds often hedge long stock positions with puts
   - Large put buying ≠ always bearish
   - Need to see the full picture

5. **Overtrading**
   - Quality over quantity
   - Wait for high-conviction setups
   - Don't chase every signal

## Best Practices

1. **Paper trade first** (1-3 months)
   - Track signals without risking money
   - Learn what works, what doesn't
   - Build confidence

2. **Start conservative**
   - Trade the underlying stock based on flow
   - Less leverage = less risk for beginners

3. **Position sizing**
   - Never risk >2-5% per trade
   - Size appropriately for your account

4. **Use stops**
   - Always have an exit plan
   - Don't let losers run

5. **Combine with technicals**
   - Support/resistance levels
   - Trend direction
   - Volume patterns

6. **Track performance**
   - Log all trades and signals
   - Review what works
   - Continuously improve
