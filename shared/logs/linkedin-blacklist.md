# LinkedIn Blacklist

Contacts to **NEVER** engage with. This list overrides all other targeting criteria.

## Purpose

This blacklist ensures you avoid engaging with:
- Contacts who explicitly requested no contact
- Inappropriate targets identified through experience
- Any other contacts you want to exclude permanently

## Usage Rules

**All LinkedIn skills MUST check this blacklist before any engagement action:**
- Before commenting on posts
- Before sending connection requests
- Before sending DMs
- Before any interaction

If a contact is on this blacklist, skip them entirely and move to the next target.
