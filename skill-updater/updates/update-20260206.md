## File Updates

### File: linkedin-icp-warmer/skill.md

#### Change 1: ADD_SECTION
Location: After section "## Workflow"
Description: Adds mandatory Blacklist Check as Step 0 before any prospect warming. Standardized safety gate across all skills.
Content:
~~~
### Step 0: Blacklist Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**CRITICAL: Before identifying ANY prospect for warming, check the blacklist.**

**File location:** `shared/logs/linkedin-blacklist.md`

```
BEFORE WARMING ANY PROSPECT:
1. Read linkedin-blacklist.md
2. Check if prospect name OR profile URL appears in blacklist
3. If FOUND → SKIP ENTIRELY, remove from warming pipeline
4. If NOT FOUND → Proceed with warming workflow
```

**This check overrides ALL other criteria. Never engage with blacklisted contacts.**
~~~

#### Change 2: MODIFY_SECTION
Section: "### Step 0a: Cache-First Check"
Find: **File location:** `shared/logs/icp-prospects.md` → Profile Cache table
Replace with:

Find: WARMING OPTIMIZATION (SALES NAVIGATOR):
Replace with:
~~~
WARMING OPTIMIZATION (SALES NAVIGATOR):

🔥 PRIORITY #1: "POSTED ON LINKEDIN" FILTER (ALWAYS ENABLE FIRST)

When searching for NEW prospects to warm, ALWAYS use the "Posted on LinkedIn"
filter in Sales Navigator. This is THE most efficient way to find warm-able
prospects because every search result has recent posts to engage with.

WORKFLOW FOR NEW PROSPECT DISCOVERY + WARMING:
1. Open Sales Navigator saved search (with ICP filters)
2. Enable "Posted on LinkedIn" filter (under Spotlight section)
3. For each prospect found:
   → View their recent post directly in Sales Navigator
   → Click to open full post on LinkedIn
   → Comment using linkedin-pro-commenter
   → Save prospect to icp-prospects.md with 1 touch
4. Result: Every prospect discovered is immediately engaged
~~~

#### Change 5: ADD_SECTION
Location: After section "## Edge Cases"
Description: Adds Comment Hunting strategy for warming INACTIVE prospects who actively comment on others' posts. Includes workflow, example, and efficiency metrics.
Content:
~~~
### Comment Hunting: Warming INACTIVE Posters Who Actively Comment

**Problem:** Some high-value ICP prospects don't post content but actively comment on others' posts.

**Solution:** Find their comments on others' posts and reply to those comments.

#### When to Use Comment Hunting
- INACTIVE (no posts 30+ days) but actively comments → YES
- INACTIVE with no comments visible → NO
- ACTIVE (posts regularly) → NO, use standard warming

#### Comment Hunting Workflow
1. Navigate to: https://www.linkedin.com/in/[username]/recent-activity/comments/
2. Find substantive comments (technical, strategic, questions)
3. Generate reply using linkedin-pro-commenter (30-50 words max)
4. Update icp-prospects.md with touch increment and "COMMENT HUNTING" note
~~~

#### Change 6: ADD_SECTION
Location: After section "### Comment Hunting"
Description: Adds Scheduled Comment Monitoring - systematic daily rotation through INACTIVE prospects to find hidden engagement opportunities and classify activity patterns.
Content:
~~~
### Scheduled Comment Monitoring (Daily Rotation)

**Goal:** Rotate through ALL INACTIVE prospects' comment tabs daily.

#### Rotation Schedule
- Daily check: 5 INACTIVE prospects
- Full cycle: ~100 INACTIVE prospects every 20 days
- Recheck interval: Every 14 days per prospect
- Time per check: ~1 minute per prospect

#### Status Transitions
- INACTIVE → COMMENT_ACTIVE (found substantive comments, elevated priority)
- INACTIVE → INACTIVE (low-quality comments only, recheck in 14 days)
- INACTIVE → INACTIVE_VERIFIED (3 consecutive "No activity" checks, monthly rotation)

#### Priority Ranking (Updated)
| Status | Warming Priority | Strategy |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| ACTIVE | HIGHEST | Standard warming |
| COMMENT_ACTIVE | HIGH | Comment Hunting |
| MODERATE | MEDIUM | Standard warming when posts appear |
| INACTIVE | LOW | Scheduled Comment Monitoring rotation |
| INACTIVE_VERIFIED | LOWEST | Monthly check |
~~~

#### Change 7: ADD_SECTION
Location: After section "### Scheduled Comment Monitoring"
Description: Adds Profile Recommendations Discovery - leverages LinkedIn's algorithm to find lookalike prospects from profile sidebar recommendations.
Content:
~~~
## Profile Recommendations Discovery (NEW)

**Strategy:** When viewing any prospect's profile, LinkedIn displays similar profiles in a sidebar. These are algorithmically clustered by role, industry, location, and network - high-probability ICP matches.

### Discovery Workflow
1. Navigate to existing prospect profile
2. Extract recommendation data (name, role, company, location, URL)
3. ICP Qualification Check against core criteria
4. Save qualified prospects to icp-prospects.md with source notation

### Integration Points
- During ICP Warming (1 visit = warming + discovery)
- During Algorithm Training (morning block visits)
- Dedicated Discovery Sessions (3-5 seeds = 15-30 new prospects)

### Efficiency: 30 sec/profile, HIGH quality, 3-5 prospects per seed
~~~

#### Change 8: ADD_TO_LIST
Section: "## Trigger"
After line containing: "check prospect posts"

~~~
- "find lookalike prospects"

### Sub-Agent Optimization
Per-block sub-agents reduce token usage by isolating context.
- Morning Sub-Agent: Feed Discovery, Algorithm Training, Hashtag Discovery
- Content Sub-Agent: Trending topic analysis, post generation
- Midday/Afternoon Sub-Agent: Prospect engagement
- Evening Sub-Agent: DM check, pipeline review
Token savings: ~60% reduction per block execution.
~~~

#### Change 11: ADD_SECTION
Location: After section "### Sub-Agent Optimization"
Description: Adds Mandatory Duplicate Check Protocol to prevent double-commenting on posts across time blocks and sessions.
Content:
~~~
### Mandatory Duplicate Check Protocol
Session-level duplicate prevention using post URL as single source of truth.
Decision tree: Extract post URL → Check linkedin-activity.md → If found: SKIP → If not: ENGAGE.
Fail-safe rule: If unable to confirm URL uniqueness, SKIP the post.
